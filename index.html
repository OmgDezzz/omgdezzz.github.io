                    <p>
                        I was born in Holguin, Cuba, and I proudly served in the United States Navy as a Corpsman, 
                        which is the Navy’s equivalent of a medic. During my time in the Navy, I gained extensive 
                        experience in the medical field, providing critical care and support to my fellow service members. 
                        After my service, I transitioned into the world of academia and am currently studying Computer Science 
                        and Artificial Intelligence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As an aspiring entrepreneur, I am working on various projects spanning across different industries. 
                        From innovative furniture distribution and clothing designs to software development and cutting-edge artificial 
                        intelligence solutions, I am dedicated to bringing unique ideas to life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This website serves as the hub for all my different projects. You can navigate the menu above to 
                        explore the various products and services I offer. If you are looking for a great place to eat, 
                        I highly recommend visiting my sister’s restaurant located in Highland Perkins: "Pizza Art Wine". 
                        It’s a fantastic spot with delicious food and a wonderful atmosphere!
