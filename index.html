                I was born in Holguin, Cuba. I am a United States Navy veteran, and I worked in the medical field as a Corpsman, which is the Navy term for a medic. Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for entrepreneurship. I am working on several exciting projects ranging from furniture and clothing to software and AI. This website serves as a hub for all my different projects, and you can explore them by navigating the menu above. If you're looking for a great place to eat, check out my sisterâ€™s restaurant, <strong>"Pizza Art Wine"</strong> located in Highland Perkins.
