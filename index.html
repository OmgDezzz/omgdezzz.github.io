        <h1>Welcome to Repository-V</h1>
        <p>I was born in Holguin, Cuba. I am a United States Navy veteran, and I worked in the medical field as a Corpsman, which is the Navy term for a medic. Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, with a passion for entrepreneurship. I am working on several exciting projects ranging from furniture and clothing to software and AI. This website serves as a hub for all my different projects, and you can explore them by navigating the menu above.
